			<h2>About me</h2>
			<img src="img/Headshot.png" width=150px height=200px style="float: right; padding: 10px">

			<p>I'm a third-year student of Computer Science at Purdue University, West Lafayette, following the Systems Programming and Programming Languages tracks. I'm currently a member of the Purude Formula SAE team, working on the electronics subteam, where I build tools for working with the CAN Bus that controls the race car, develop and configure the ECU, and collect and analyze telemetry. I also play in the first violin section of the Purdue Symphony Orchestra For the past two years, I was the Software Team Leader of the Purdue SIGBots VEX U Robotics team, where I led a team of about 6 other Computer Science students to design and implement the control systems for the drivetrain, arm, and claw subsystems on the competition robot. I was also a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu">PROS</a> dev team, the only free/libre development platform for the VEX Cortex and V5 microcontrollers.</p>

			<h2>Work Experience</h2>

			<h3>Honeywell</h3>
			<p>I am proud to announce that I have accepted an internship position at Honeywell's software development center in Atlanta, Georgia for the Spring of 2019. I will be working in the Connected Enterprises field</p>

			<h3>Clear Software</h3>
			<p>During the summer of 2017, I worked as an intern at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://clearsoftware.com">Clear Software</a>, a small startup in my hometown of Zionsville, Indiana that creates automation for enterprise platforms such as Oracle, SAP, and others. I primarily customized instances of the software to the needs of clients using Django templates. I also developed an interface in Python that would allow the product to connect to HTTP-based business systems. Through my work at Clear, I gained experience in python development and frontend design. I also learned a lot about the Agile method and working with clients to gather requirements.</p>

			<h3>IMS Productions</h3>
			<p>For the past three summers (2016-2018), I have traveled to several IndyCar races to work for IMS Productions, which broadcasts the events on NBC and ESPN. I was contracted as a utility worker, and my duties involved assiting the fiber crews in running their fiber optic lines around the tracks and placing and refuelling generators throughout the facilities for the trackside cameras. I also worked on the pit lane during the races either holding the "jerk cam" (portable monitor) for the pit reporters or managing batteries for the handheld cameras. During the 2017 and 2018 runnings of the Indianapolis 500, I worked in the Timing and Scoring room of the famous Pagoda, where I was assisted with the pre- and post-race programs. I had many opportunities to network and meet with engineers, mechanics, and officials around the paddock and learn more about the sport and IndyCar operations.</p>
