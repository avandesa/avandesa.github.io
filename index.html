			<h2>Work Experience</h2>

			<h3>Clear Software</h3>
			<p>During the summer of 2017, I worked as an intern at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://clearsoftware.com">Clear Software</a>, a small startup in my hometown of Zionsville, Indiana that creates automation for enterprise platforms such as Oracle, SAP, and others. I primarily customized instances of the software to the needs of clients using the in-house templating system. I also developed an interface in Python that would allow the product to connect to HTTP-based business systems. Through my work at Clear, I gained experience in python development and frontend design. I also learned a lot about the Agile method and working with clients to gather requirements.</p>

			<h3>IMS Productions</h3>
			<p>For the past three summers (2016-2018), I have travelled to several INDYCAR races to work for IMS Productions, which broadcasts the events on NBC and ESPN. I was contracted as a utility worker, and my duties involved assiting the fiber crews in running their fiber optic lines around the tracks and placing and refuelling generators throughout the facilities for the trackside cameras. I also worked on the pit lane during the races either holding the "jerk cam" (portable monitor) for the pit reporters or managing batteries for the handheld cameras. During the 2017 and 2018 runnings of the Indianapolis 500, I worked in the Timing and Scoring room of the famous Pagoda, where I was responsible for distributing radios for the pre- and post-race stage crews. While the work was not very technical, I had many opportunities to network and be up close and part of the action on track. I got to travel to races at Road America, WI and Mid-Ohio Sportscar Course, OH.</p>
